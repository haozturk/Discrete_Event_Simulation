-> I have 3 header files and corresponding 3 cpp files and a main.cpp file in this Project. I also added the CMakeLists.txt file.

-> General Process is done in the main.cpp

-> I tried the code in VM with the command ./project2 inputFile outputFile
 
-> I get the correct results from all the test cases, i checked them with https://www.diffchecker.com/diff this tool

-> There is an additional empty line in each of the output file. I think it's not a problem for you

-> All test cases are finished in less than a second except the one that has large input. It takes 5 seconds on average. I thought that it is a reasonable time.

Best regards
